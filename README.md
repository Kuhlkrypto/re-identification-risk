# Quantifying the Re-identification Risk of Event Logs for Process Mining

The re-identification risk is quantified with measures for the individual uniqueness in event logs.

## Usage
### Step 1 Preparation of the data
Summarize all event data that occurs for the corresponding case. After conversion, each row in this data set belongs to one case. 
- Specify the path of the event log (csv)
- Specify the unique identifier and the list of attributes to consider
...

### Step 2 Calculate unicity 
Unicity is the number of cases that are uniquely identifiable by the set of case attributes or the set of event attributes.
In *unicity_activities.py* specify:
- the path for the event log (output of Step 1).
- the columnnames for the unique identifier, activities, timestamp, event and case attributes.
- the projection that should be considered.
Projection refer to a subset of attributes in the event log.
It is possible to specify the number of points as an absolute number or as a relative frequency.
The algorithm outputs the ratio of unique cases to the total number of cases.
